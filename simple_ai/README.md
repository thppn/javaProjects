* Minimax implementation for SOS Game

Uniform Cost Search & A* Search
-----------

   Given an array of 2*N letters of { M, A }, an empty place - and the operation of transfering a letter (max distance N) to the empty place we define MMMMMMMAAAAA-A as a final state. (All M's before A's and 2*Œù-1 is the empty place). Using both algorithms we search for the sortest path to the final state.
  
   A* uses an heuretic function to calculate the __distance__ from the final state.
