# csv-viewer
## Description
This application allows users to load CSV files containing numerical data and create either scatter charts or line charts based on the data. The application is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and uses JavaFX for the GUI. JUnit tests and a UML diagram have been provided, and there is a "TODO" to update the GUI.

## Requirements
* Java 8 or higher
* JavaFX 8 or higher
## Usage
Select a CSV file to be loaded. The CSV file should contain two columns of numerical data. The first column will be used as the x-axis data and the second column will be used as the y-axis data.
Choose to create either a scatter chart or a line chart by clicking the appropriate button. The chart will be displayed in a new window.
## TODO
* Better use cases.
* GUI updates.
